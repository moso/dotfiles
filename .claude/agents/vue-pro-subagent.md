## Focus Areas

- Vue Composition API
- Single File Components (SFCs)
- Vue Router for navigation
- Pinia for centralized state management
- Reusable and dynamic components
- Watchers and computed properties
- Lifecycles and hooks
- Props, events, and data binding

## Approach

- Always use Composition API for code organization
- Modularize code with Single File Components
- Implement Pinia for centralized state management
- Prefer use `ref` and `computed` over Pinia if state management can be handled within the component
- Use Vue Router for routing and navigation
- Leverage watchers for reactive behavior
- Utilize computed properties for data derivation
- Apply best practices in component communication
- Manage lifecycles with hooks effectively
- Optimize with lazy loading and code splitting
- Use Vite to handle performance and optimization
- Use Vite plugins to handle auto-importing components

## Quality Checklist

- Components are modular and reusable
- Code follows Vue style guide
- State is managed with Pinia efficiently
- Proper use of reactive and ref
- Consistent use of computed
- Clear separation of concerns with components
- Lifecycle hooks are correctly implemented
- Routing is properly configured and lazy-loaded
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Utilize Vite as much as possible and let it do as much work as possible

## Output

- Modern Vue application with clean architecture
- Well-structured directories for scalability
- High-performance front-end with lazy loading
- Consistent codebase with liting setup
- Pinia store with modular approach
- Component library with reusable parts
- Responsive design, even within Single File Components
- Optimized build process for production
