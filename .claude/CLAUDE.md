## `context-mode` - MANDATORY Routing Rules
You have `context-mode` MCP tools available. These rules are **NOT** optional.

### **BLOCKED** Commands - Do **NOT** attempt these

#### `curl` / `wget` - **BLOCKED**
Any Bash command containing `curl` or `wget` is intercepted by `context-mode` and replaced with an error message. Do NOT retry. Instead use:
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` to fetch and index web pages.
- `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")` to return HTTP calls in sandbox.

#### Inline HTTP - **BLOCKED**
Any Bash command containing `fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, or `http.request(` is intercepted by `context-mode` and replaced with an error message. Do NOT retry with Bash. Instead use:
- `ctx_execute(lang, code)` to run HTTP calls in sandbox - only `stdout` enters context.

#### WebFetch - **BLOCKED**
WebFetch calls are denied entirely. The URL is extracted, and you are told to use `ctx_fetch_and_index` instead. Instead use:
- `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` to query the indexed content.

### **REDIRECTED** tools - use sandbox equivalents

#### Bash (>20 lines output)
Bash is ONLY for `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `bun install`, `npm install`, `pip install`, and other short-output commands. For everything else, use:
- `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` - run multiple commands + search in ONE call.
- `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")` - run in sandbox, only `stdout` enters context.

#### Read (for analysis)
If you are reading a file to **Edit** it, then **Read** is correct. If you are reading to `analyze`, `explore`, or `summarize` -> use `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` instead. Only your printed summary enters context. The raw file content stays in the sandbox.

#### Grep (large results)
Grep results can flood the context window. Use `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` to run searches in a sandbox. Only your printed summary enters context.

### Tool Selection Hierarchy
1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` - Primary tool. Runs all commands, auto-indexes output, and returns search results. **ONE** call replaces 30+ individual calls.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` - Query indexed content. Pass **ALL** questions as an array in **ONE** call.
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` - Sandbox execution. Only `stdout` enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` - Fetch, chunk, index, query. Raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` - Store content in FTS5 knowledge base for later search.

### Output Constraints
- Keep responses under 500 words.
- Write artifacts(code, configs, PRDs) to **FILES** - never return them as inline text.
- Return only: file path + 1-line description.
- When indexing content, use descriptive source labels so others can `ctx_search(source: "label")` later.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for **ANY** non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes sideways, **STOP** and re-plan immediately, don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents.
- One task per subagent for focused execution.

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After **ANY** correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops.
- Review lessons at session start for the relevant project.
- If any `cspell` configuration file is found in the project root, ignore **ALL** CSpell spelling diagnostics. Danish words and domain-specific terms may appear. Treat them as correct. Do **NOT** fix, attempt to fix, comment on, or flag spelling errors from CSpell.

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behaviour between main and your changes when relevant.
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask: "Is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution".
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, and failing tests, then resolve them.
- Zero context switching required from the user.
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write a plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items.
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation.
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go.
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step.
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`.
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections.

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
